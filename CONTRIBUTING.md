## 📜 Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/). By participating, you agree to uphold these standards. Please report unacceptable behavior to the maintainers.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 22 (LTS recommended)
- npm (bundled with Node 22) or bun
- Docker (for running a local Grafana instance)
- Git

### Quick Setup

```bash
# 1) Fork and clone your fork
https clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/calendar-heatmap-panel.git
cd calendar-heatmap-panel

# 2) Install dependencies
npm install

# 3) Start plugin dev server
npm run dev

# 4) Start Grafana in Docker (separate terminal)
npm run server
```

Access Grafana at http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin).

## 🛠️ How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

1. Search existing issues first.
2. Reproduce with the latest main branch.
3. Provide details: Grafana version, plugin version, browser/OS, steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, and console/network errors.

### Requesting Features

1. Check for existing requests.
2. Describe the use case and value.
3. Propose an approach if possible; be open to alternatives.

### Submitting Enhancements

- Keep changes focused and minimal.
- Update or add tests for new logic.
- Update documentation when behavior changes.

## 💻 Development Environment

### Commands

```bash
npm run dev        # Hot reload development
npm run build      # Production build
npm run server     # Grafana + plugin in Docker
npm run lint       # ESLint
npm run lint:fix   # Autofix lint issues
npm run typecheck  # TypeScript type checks
npm run test       # Unit tests (watch)
npm run test:ci    # Unit tests (CI)
npm run e2e        # Playwright end-to-end
npm run sign       # Sign plugin for distribution
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
GRAFANA_VERSION=11.6.0 npm run server  # Pin Grafana version

## 📝 Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript & React

- Strict TypeScript; no implicit `any`.
- Named exports; avoid default exports unless a file has a single clear export.
- Explicit prop typing; avoid `React.FC` unless children typing is needed.
- Keep components small and focused.
- Use `useMemo`/`useCallback` for expensive work or stable references passed to memoized children.
- Prefer pure functions in `utils/` for data processing.
- Handle empty/invalid data gracefully; never throw uncaught errors from render paths.

### Styling

- Uses Emotion CSS with Grafana theme tokens (`useTheme2`).
- Keep styles co-located with components and memoize theme-dependent style objects when non-trivial.

### Accessibility

- Use semantic elements; every interactive element must be keyboard accessible.
- Provide labels for inputs/switches; tooltips should not be the sole means of conveying information.

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

- Unit tests (Jest) for utilities and logic (aggregation, palettes, sizing).
- Component tests (React Testing Library) for rendering and interactions where feasible.
- E2E tests (Playwright) for critical flows: rendering the panel, tooltips, option changes.
- Run `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test:ci`, and `npm run e2e` before submitting PRs.

### Example Unit Test (aggregation)

```typescript
describe('aggregate', () => {
  it('sums values', () => {
    expect(aggregate([1, 2, 3], 'sum')).toBe(6);
  });
});
```

## 🔄 Pull Request Process

1. Branch from `main`.
2. Keep PRs small and scoped; include rationale in the description.
3. Ensure all checks pass: lint, typecheck, tests, e2e (when applicable).
4. Update docs and changelog entries when user-facing behavior changes.
5. Request review from a maintainer; address feedback promptly.

- Optional
```

## 🎯 Plugin Development Best Practices

- Validate DataFrames: require one time field and one numeric field; surface clear errors to users.
- Keep data processing pure; no side effects in aggregation helpers.
- Memoize derived data and styles to minimize re-renders.
- Respect Grafana theme and accessibility defaults (contrast, focus states).
- Avoid expensive synchronous work in render; precompute in hooks.

## 📝 Commit Message Conventions

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat`: new feature
- `fix`: bug fix
- `docs`: documentation only
- `refactor`: code change without behavior change
- `test`: add or update tests
- `chore`: tooling, build, or dependency updates
- `perf`: performance improvements

Examples:

```
feat(heatmap): add teal color scheme
fix(data): guard against null numeric fields
```
