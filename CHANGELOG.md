## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-17

### Added

#### Core Features

- **Calendar heatmap visualization** with GitHub-style grid layout displaying activity patterns across a full year
- **Real-time data updates** based on Grafana time range picker with automatic refresh when time range changes
- **Standard Grafana time-series data support** (DataFrame) with automatic detection and processing of timestamp-value pairs
- **GitHub contribution graph aesthetics** with familiar visual patterns for developers and data analysts

#### Color Schemes

- **6 built-in color palettes**: Green (GitHub-style), Blue (professional), Red (alerts/errors), Yellow (warnings), Purple (creative), Orange (energetic)
- **Theme-aware empty cell colors** that automatically adapt to Grafana's dark mode, light mode, and high-contrast themes
- **Dynamic color scaling** with 4 intensity levels providing clear visual distinction between low and high activity periods
- **Customizable color intensity mapping** with smart distribution algorithms for optimal visual contrast

#### Data Processing

- **5 aggregation methods** for handling multiple data points per day:
  - **Sum**: Total of all values (ideal for counts, quantities)
  - **Count**: Number of data points (useful for frequency analysis)
  - **Average**: Mean value (smooths out outliers)
  - **Maximum**: Highest value (highlights peak activity)
  - **Minimum**: Lowest value (identifies baseline activity)
- **Intelligent data handling** with automatic filtering of null, undefined, and NaN values to prevent visualization errors
- **Automatic precision control** with rounding to 2 decimal places for clean tooltip display
- **Robust timestamp parsing** supporting multiple date formats and timezone handling

#### Customization Options

- **Auto-sizing cells** that automatically adjust to fit panel width for optimal space utilization
- **Manual cell size control** with slider range from 8-20 pixels for fine-tuned appearance
- **Configurable cell spacing** from 1-24 pixels allowing tight or loose grid layouts
- **Adjustable corner radius** from 0-6 pixels for square to rounded cell appearance
- **Optional week day labels** (Sun-Sat) with abbreviated or full names
- **Optional month labels** (Jan-Dec) with intelligent positioning and responsive sizing
- **Optional legend display** with color intensity scale and value range indicators

#### User Interaction

- **Interactive hover tooltips** showing formatted date and aggregated value with customizable precision
- **Toggle tooltip visibility** for clean screenshots or presentation mode
- **Responsive layout** that gracefully adapts to various panel dimensions and screen sizes
- **Smooth hover animations** providing immediate visual feedback
- **Accessibility support** with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

#### Technical Implementation

- **React 18.3.0** with modern functional components, hooks, and concurrent features
- **TypeScript 5.9.2** with strict type checking, ensuring type safety and better developer experience
- **Grafana SDK 12.3.1** full compatibility with latest Grafana APIs:
  - `@grafana/data` for DataFrame processing and time series handling
  - `@grafana/ui` for consistent theme integration and UI components
  - `@grafana/runtime` for plugin lifecycle and configuration management
  - `@grafana/schema` for type-safe configuration options
  - `@grafana/i18n` for internationalization support
- **@uiw/react-heat-map 2.3.3** for performant core heatmap visualization engine
- **Emotion CSS 11.10.6** for dynamic styling with theme integration and CSS-in-JS benefits

#### Development Infrastructure

- **Webpack 5 build system** with modern module federation and tree-shaking optimizations
- **SWC compilation** for ultra-fast TypeScript/JavaScript transformation
- **Jest 29 testing framework** with React Testing Library for comprehensive unit test coverage
- **Playwright 1.57** for end-to-end testing across multiple browsers and Grafana versions
- **ESLint 9** with comprehensive rule sets:
  - TypeScript-specific linting for type safety
  - React hooks rules for proper hook usage
  - JSDoc enforcement for better documentation
- **Prettier 3** for consistent code formatting across the entire codebase
- **Docker Compose development environment** with Grafana Enterprise for realistic testing scenarios
- **Plugin signing support** for official Grafana plugin catalog distribution
- **Automated build pipeline** with version management and artifact generation

#### Plugin Configuration

- **Grafana dependency**: Compatible with Grafana >=11.6.0
- **Plugin ID**: `tim012432-calendarheatmap-panel` for unique identification
- **Plugin type**: Panel plugin integrating seamlessly with Grafana's dashboard ecosystem
- **Keywords**: heatmap, calendar, github, contributions, activity for discoverability

#### Documentation & Assets

- **Comprehensive screenshots** demonstrating multiple themes and configurations:
  - Light theme with orange color scheme
  - Dark theme with green color scheme
  - Tron theme with blue color scheme
  - Configuration panel overview
- **Plugin logo** with SVG format for crisp display at any size
- **GitHub repository integration** with direct links to source code and issue tracking

#### Performance Optimizations

- **Efficient data rendering** with virtualized components for large datasets
- **Optimized re-rendering** using React.memo and useMemo for expensive calculations
- **Lazy loading** of non-critical components to improve initial load times
- **Memory-efficient** data structures preventing memory leaks in long-running dashboards
